        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li><br>
        <li>Css describes how HTML,elements are to be displyed on screen,paper,or in other media</li><br>
        <li><del>CSS is not neccssary</del> <mark> Css saves a lot of work</mark>.It can cantrol the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
        <li style="font-style: italic;"><u> External stylesheet are stored in CSS failur</u> </li> <br>

    </ol>
    

    <h1 style="color: red;"><b>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</b></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using the style elements inside in side head section </li>
        <li>External - by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file </li>
        <li> The most common way to add Css. is to keep the style in external CSS files. however, <mark>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark> beacuse this is easier to 
        demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself</li>

    </ul>

    <p style="color: brown; font-weight:lighter; font-size:larger">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class 
        applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,
        applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.
        to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>

        <p style="color: brown; font-size:xx-small;">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element 
            or range of elements on a webpage. Once an element has 
            been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied 
            to the elements.</p>

            <p style="color: brown; font-style:italic">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
